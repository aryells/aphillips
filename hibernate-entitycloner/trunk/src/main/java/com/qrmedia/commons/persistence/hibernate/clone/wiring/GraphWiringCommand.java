     * Rather than executing the wiring up in commands, it might at first glance appear
     * easier to have a HibernateEntityGraphCloner.registerLink method and allow the
     * entity graph cloner to link the objects once all clones have been created.
     * 
     * This would, however, require the graph cloner to know how to link objects and thus
     * limit the types of possible links to those supported by the cloner.
     * This would represent a strong and avoidable coupling; in any case, the responsibility
     * for wiring up the clones should lie with whoever discovered the link in the first
     * place! The command pattern allows the discoverer of the link to wire up items in any
     * way necessary (by creating a suitable subclass of GraphWiringCommand).
