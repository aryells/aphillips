/**
 * MultiSPI aims to make it
 * <ul>
 * <li>easy to detect and load SPI implementations within applications that provide an SPI
 * <li>easy to apply tailored validation and error checking strategies for implementations
 * <li>easy to extend the number of ways by which SPI implementors can provide implementations.
 * <p>
 * MultiSPI offers three main advantages over the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} provided in Java 6:
 * <ol>
 * <li>it supports &quot;lenient&quot; loading of service implementations, e.g. allowing the host
 *   application to perform its own checks before loading the class and/or accepting it as a valid
 *   implementation
 * <li>out-of-the-box, it supports finding service implementations also on the basis of other 
 *   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">Manifest</a>
 *   entries, as well as by scanning for marker annotations
 * <li>it provides pluggable support for additional, user-defined service implementation finding 
 *   strategies
 * </ol>
