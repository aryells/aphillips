/**
 * &quot;Crawls&quot; a dynamically-discovered graph, starting from a given root or roots,
 * and passing each node to all registered {@link NodeVisitor NodeVisitors}.
 * <p>
 * The visitors may &quot;discover&quot; additional nodes, and register these with the
 * traverser. The order in which the nodes are visited is up to implementing classes.
 * <p>
 * Nodes will only be visited once, i.e. if a node is added that is equal to (in the sense of
 * Java's <code>equals</code> method) a node that has already been or is waiting to be visited,
 * it will not be scheduled again.<br/>
 * This does not apply to the <i>initial</i> nodes, all of which will be visited.
 * <p>
 * Traversal of the graph stops once no further nodes are queued to be visited, or if one of
 * the visitors explicitly aborts graph traversal.
 * <p>
 * An object representing the traversal's state is initially passed in by the caller, and,
 * if used, is modified by visitors as appropriate. For instance, this might be a collection
 * of errors.
 * <p>
 * If no traversal state is required, <code>null</code> may be passed.
 * <p>
 * Offers similar functionality to the {@link ObjectGraphIterator}, which may be a useful
 * alternative if this interface does not quite suit.
