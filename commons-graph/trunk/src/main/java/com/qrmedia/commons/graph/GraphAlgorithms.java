     * <u>Maximum Cardinality Matching</u>
     * <p>
     * For a given undirected graph G, a matching is a subset S of edges of G in which no
     * two edges in S are adjacent in G. The maximum cardinality matching problem is to
     * find a maching of maximum cardinality.
     * <p>
     * A node that is not matched is called an exposed node. An alternating path with
     * respect to a given matching S is a path in which the edges appear alternately in S
     * and not in S. An augmenting path is an alternating path which begins with an
     * exposed node and ends with another exposed node. A fundamental theorem states that
     * a matching S in G is maximum if and only if G has no augmenting path with respect to S.
     * <p>
     * The basic method for finding the maximum matching starts with an arbitrary
     * matching Q. An augmenting path P with respect to Q is found. A new matching
     * is constructed by taking those edges of P or Q that are not in both P and Q. The
     * process is repeated and the matching is maximum when no augmenting path is
     * found. The algorithm takes O(n&#179) operations for a graph of n nodes.
     * 
     * @param n     the number of nodes of the graph, labeled from 1 to n
     * @param edges the edges of the graph, with first and second nodes between 1 and n
     * @return the set of edges representing the maximum cardinality matching, and the
     *         number of unmatched nodes
