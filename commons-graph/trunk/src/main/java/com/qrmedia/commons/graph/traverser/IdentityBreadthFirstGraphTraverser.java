/**
 * A {@link BreadthFirstGraphTraverser} that uses object <i>identity</i> rather than
 * <i>equality</i> as the criterion for revisting objects. In other words, the
 * traverser will <u>revisit</u> items that are equal but not identical 
 * (<code>o1.equals(o2) && (o1 != o2)</code>). Identical objects are only visited
 * once (this does not hold for the objects initially passed).
 * <p>
 * Intended for the rare cases in which object identity is required, e.g. deep cloning.
